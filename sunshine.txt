Sometimes, all I wonder is how your heart works. Does it beat for me? Can I dance to the beat?
Baby, all of me is falling for you. Will you hold me?
All I need is a yes from you. All that’s required is your acceptance.
In you, I find comfort and happiness while I face the challenges life presents to me. Your presence makes me feel alive and I am loving every bit of it

 Listening to your voice blows my heart away. It makes me feel better than I’ve ever felt.
Your love has created a path for me. Sometimes, I wonder how I would have made it this far without you and your love.
You have made me feel so much fulfillment and happiness that my poor heart has never consumed. I am grateful for your unconditional love that never runs dry

I really love you my sunshine .
